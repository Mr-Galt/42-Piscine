# Project C02: Advanced C String Manipulations 🚀

Greetings and welcome to Project C02, an important milestone in my 42 Piscine journey! This project delves deeper into the C programming language, focusing on the manipulation and understanding of strings. 🛠️

In this project, I've built a number of functions to tackle various operations related to string handling. Each function illuminates a different aspect of working with strings in C.

## Inside this Project 🗂️

Here are the functions that I've implemented in this project:

1. `ft_strcpy.c`: A function that copies a string from source to destination.
2. `ft_strncpy.c`: This function copies 'n' characters from the source string to the destination string.
3. `ft_str_is_alpha.c`: A function that checks if a string is alphabetic.
4. `ft_str_is_numeric.c`: This function checks if a string is numeric.
5. `ft_str_is_lowercase.c`: A function that checks if a string is in lowercase.
6. `ft_str_is_uppercase.c`: This function checks if a string is in uppercase.
7. `ft_str_is_printable.c`: A function that checks if a string is printable.
8. `ft_strupcase.c`: This function transforms every letter to uppercase.
9. `ft_strlowcase.c`: A function that transforms every letter to lowercase.
10. `ft_strcapitalize.c`: A function that capitalizes the first letter of each word and transforms all other letters to lowercase.
11. `ft_strlcpy.c`: A function that copies up to 'size' characters from the source string to the destination string, null-terminating the result if 'size' is not 0.
12. `ft_putstr_non_printable.c`: This function prints a string and replaces non-printable characters with their hexadecimal representation.

## How to Use 💻

To compile any of these files, use gcc in your terminal:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror ft_strcpy.c -o ft_strcpy
```

Then, to run the compiled file, simply type:
./ft_strcpy
