# Project C00: Exploring the C Language üöÄ

Welcome to Project C00, the first stepping stone in my coding journey at the 42 Piscine in Abu Dhabi! This project is all about diving into the nitty-gritty of the C programming language and getting our hands dirty with practical, hands-on exercises. üõ†Ô∏è

In this project, I had to implement a number of basic functions, each designed to give me (and you!) a stronger understanding of the fundamentals of C. Feel free to explore, critique, and learn from my work!

## Inside this Project üóÇÔ∏è

This project comprises of the following functions:

1. `ft_putchar.c`: A function that outputs a single character to the console.
2. `ft_print_alphabet.c`: This function displays the alphabet in lowercase, on a single line.
3. `ft_print_reverse_alphabet.c`: A mirrored version of the above function, this one prints the alphabet in reverse.
4. `ft_print_numbers.c`: A function that displays all digits, on a single line.
5. `ft_is_negative.c`: This function takes an integer and displays 'N' or 'P' depending on whether the input number is negative or positive (including zero).
6. `ft_print_comb.c`: A function that displays all different combinations of three digits in ascending order, listed by increasing order.
7. `ft_print_comb2.c`: A function that displays all different combinations of two two-digit numbers between 00 01 and 98 99 in ascending order.
8. `ft_putnbr.c`: A function that displays the number entered as a parameter, and is able to handle and display the maximum and minimum possible int values.

## How to Use üíª

To compile any of these files, use gcc in your terminal:

**cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror [file_name].c**

Then, to run the compiled file, simply type:
./a.out

## Contributing ü§ù

I'd love to hear your thoughts on these functions! Feel free to open an issue if you find a bug or think of a way to improve a function. If you'd like to make direct contributions, go ahead and make a pull request.

## Final Note üìù

Project C00 is an exciting first step in the 42 Piscine journey. It's about building the basic building blocks that will be invaluable in the future. Explore, learn and enjoy!
