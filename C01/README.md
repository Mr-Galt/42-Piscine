# Project C01: Delving Deeper into C 🚀

Hello, world! Welcome back to my exciting coding journey at the 42 Piscine. Project C01 marks a deeper foray into the realm of C programming as we explore more complex functions and concepts. 🛠️

In this project, I've developed several functions, each designed to challenge my understanding of C and lay the groundwork for more advanced programming tasks ahead.

## Inside this Project 🗂️

Here's a snapshot of the functions I've implemented in this project:

1. `ft_ft.c`: A function that takes a pointer to an int as argument and modifies the value of the int to 42.
2. `ft_ultimate_ft.c`: This function takes a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to an int, and sets the value of the int to 42.
3. `ft_swap.c`: A function that swaps the values of two integers whose addresses are passed as parameters.
4. `ft_div_mod.c`: This function divides two integers and stores the result in a int pointed by div, and the remainder of the division in an int pointed by mod.
5. `ft_ultimate_div_mod.c`: This function divides parameters a and b. The result of this division is stored in the int pointed by div. The remainder of the division is stored in the int pointed by mod.
6. `ft_putstr.c`: A function that outputs a string to the console.
7. `ft_strlen.c`: This function calculates and returns the length of a string.
8. `ft_rev_int_tab.c`: A function that reverses the order of elements in an array of integers.
9. `ft_sort_int_tab.c`: A function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order.

## How to Use 💻

To compile any of these files, use gcc in your terminal:

**gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror ft_ft.c -o ft_ft**

Then, to run the compiled file, simply type:

**./ft_ft**

## Contributing 🤝

Your thoughts and input are always welcome! Feel free to open an issue if you encounter a bug or think of a way to improve a function. If you'd like to contribute directly, feel free to make a pull request.

## Wrapping Up 📝

Project C01 offers a deeper understanding of C and the intricacies of problem-solving. Don't rush through the functions - take the time to understand their workings and appreciate the beauty of coding!

Please ensure to replace the `ft_ft.c` and related placeholders with the actual exercises in your C01 project. Happy coding!
